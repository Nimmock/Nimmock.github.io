For quite a few years now, I've floated around tech spaces and bounced between various jobs. I've done graphic/web design, game design, IT work, E-Commerce, and finally hardware recycling where I currently am. So far, they've left me with a lot of technical knowledge and basic job skills, but very little in the way of an actual professional career. Something can certainly be said about my lack of ability to make one out of what I've learned from my experience, but is neither here nor there.

Over the years, I've found that there are quite a few people in my life that use code in their professions of choice. Some are developers, some are designers, and a few are engineers. One thing they've all had in common is that they have tried to get me to focus my energy on learning to code. So far, I've always ignored it and focused on other things.

Turns out, if you live in the real world for a while, being stubborn about something that will increase your standard of living gets a lot less appealing as time goes on. So, here I am.
